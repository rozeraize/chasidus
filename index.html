        <h2>About Bli B.S.</h2>
        <p>
            Bli B.S. (a.k.a BBS) is a new chasidus founded by Harav Yahuda Tzvi Kaplan, and is currently being led by Harav Pinny Tauber. The
            Rav is Harav Gad Tauber Shlita, and the 2 Gabbaim are Yosef Benedak and Yosef Friedmen. Our goal is to make a chasidus without 
            any bad stuff as the name suggests.
